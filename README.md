# Bad Horse Fix

**NOTE**: As of Minecraft 1.21.2 this bug appears to be fixed! The latest version of the mod (3.0.0) should now be compatible with EVERY version of Iris/Oculus that includes the bug.

## About
This mod fixes horse markings appearing above horse armor when using the Iris or Oculus shaders mods.

Basically, this mod checks everything being rendered to see if it contains "horse", "armor", or "markings" and if it finds anything, it forces it to be rearranged. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable performance hit.

## Bugs
If you run into any glitches, bugs, or problems of any kind, please report them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/HiiJax/Bad-Horse-Fix/issues) for this mod. If issues go unreported, they also go unfixed!
